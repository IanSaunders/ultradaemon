#### Background

After being humbled by the Oner the last 3 months have been spent preparing for the NDW100, my first 100 mile race.

Shortly after the Oner Sam and I helped another friend, Martin, with his final pre-marathon run. Before this _short_ 35k run I wondered it was perhaps too soon, but what the hell, it was only 35k. My body finished the run under duress and retaliated by gifting a tweaked right knee - meaning no running for the next 6 weeks, bummer.

> Even if you feel recovered, gradually increase the distance

Nevertheless I managed to get in a decent amount of swimming and cycling whilst the leg was recovering. The Oner had been a brutal slog and I hoped the NDW100 could be a little less painful - I decided to focus on the following areas:

1. Need to work on speed and strength
1. Quads get hammered by the hills
1. Continue work on nutrition

For quads I started cranking out long bike rides around Surrey enjoying crushing/being crushed by the hills. Ironically, Box Hill was one of the section we would be running! Perhaps it would be easier on foot than on a bike?

After 6 weeks of cross-training the tweaked knee felt better and I was ready to run. An initial 10k with Sam ended up being a horrendous stop-start jog of pain and self-loathing - we had some work to do.

As part of my recovery plan I started doing a bunch of fartleks, Yasso 800s and park runs. I was able to lower my 5k PB by a minute of so after getting back into things so the speed/strength training was on-track.

All-in-all I didn't manage a run greater than *cough* 25kms, so let's hope the solid base and all the cycling would be enough... It's also worth mentioning that I lots of targeted 5/10kms - so perhaps quality over quantity?

####Â Planning

Amusingly the planning went pretty much the same way as the Oner.

1. Create a big spreadsheet with time predictions
1. Break race up into 4 marathons
1. Break the marathons in check-point pace charts

The only tricky decision to make was what time we were aiming for. In the end we settled for 2 pace charts. One for a sub-24 hours finish and one for a 28-hour finish. The 28-hour pace chart was effectively +1min/km slower than the one for the 24.

The marathon pacing for the 24-hour was:

1. 4.5 hours
1. 6 hours
1. 6 hours
1. 7.5 hours

#### Pre-start

We ventured down the start at Franham on the Friday afternoon, checked into our hotel and headed over to check-in. As was the theme for the rest of the weekend, the Centurion team ran a slick yet welcoming operation. Kit-check was fair and we were off to the races - in about 12 hours!

We headed into town for last minute supplies and dinner. We over carboloaded and had spaghetti with a [table pizza](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Table+pizza), in retrospect this was too much food and not enough time to digest - ahem.

After sorting out our drop-bags and run kit we were in bed by around 8pm with a 4am wake-up call. There was a wedding party going on in our hotel - thankfully I fell asleep with ease. Sam on the other hand tossed and turned and didn't get to sleep till much later.

Arriving for the pre-race briefing we had a good look around - the room was full of expectant runners - as we put our hands up as first time 100 milers, a few nerves ran through my feet. Strolling down to the start we were ready to rock n' roll!

#### Start &rarr; CP3  <small>(0 to 39.5kms)</small>
###### Aid stations: Farnham, Puttenham, Newlands Corner, Box Hill Stepping Stones

The first 4 check-points had pretty aggressive pacing, we were roughly aiming for a 4:30 marathon time - doesn't sound too bad until you remember the 3 marathons you run after. As the countdown hit zero everyone began a staccato run down a 2-person wide path. Everyone stayed pretty bunched up and we wasted a bit of time getting past various fences. Pace was good and the weather was perfect for the start of a long day of running. I mentioned to Sam that we were on pace for 24-hours and we cracked on.

We had a good chat with a gentleman called Darryl and he regaled us with his 2016 NDW100 attempt. He too was aiming for a sub-24. His strategy the previous year was to go out hard for the first 50 miles and then grind out the final 50 miles over Detling - this year he was taking the first 50 a bit easier. As ones does we slowly ran back-and-forth and eventually passed each other.

There is not much that I can say about the first 40 kms other than it is pretty flat and a good warm up for the day to come. We heeded some advice we got at the race briefing and tried to not go out too fast in this initial section. Arriving at box-hill aid station was great and we chowed down on the cornucopia of food and snacks on offer.

#### CP3 &rarr; CP8  <small>(39.5 to 96.2kms)</small>
###### Aid stations: Reigate Hill, Caterham, Botley Hill, Knockholt Pound, Wrotham

After walking across the very scenic river crossing we launched ourselves up the Box Hill steps. After hearing so much about Box Hill, and having danced with the soul destroying hills during the Oner, I was pleasantly surprised with the gradient and distance - in no time and limited heart elevation we were at the top enjoying the lovely views. An unexpected shout awaited us at the top of the hill, Aubone, a colleague from work cheering us on! A handshake, quick photos and we marched on!

As the day worn on the heat increased - it wasn't a stonking hot day, but it certainly wasn't cool. After Box Hill we were able to drop the pace a bit, but there were a lot more rolling hills to contend with, which made it a balancing act between stomping up the hills, running the soft hills and running quicker on the flats/downhill - joy!

As we pulled into CP 5 (Reigate Hill) Sam mentioned that he was feeling the pace/heat a bit and had slightly swollen fingers. In the Oner Sam had struggled in the early race with an upset stomach due to challenges with electrolytes, for this race he had opted to go water+food only. I had stuck to my previous fueling strategy but had removed any processed sugar - sugar seemed to cause highs/lows and a sore stomach later in race. As we refueled at the aid station, Sam asked about his fingers. It was suggested he was low on salt/electrolytes - probably true, and given a salt tablet which he dutifully swallowed. We stocked up on water and snacks and began walking. 100m outside of the aid station Sam bent over and had an almighty chunder - it lasted for a good minute or so.

> First rule of running club: Don't try anything new on race day!


Sam picked himself up and we began running again, albeit slightly slower. For those of your who have met Sam before you know he will push himself to the limit and beyond, but you could see in his eyes he was a partly broken man. We cut the pace significantly and introduced some more run-walking. Thankfully we had entered part of the course we have recced a few weeks earlier so knew what to expect. I would love to say that the spring in Sam's step came back, but unfortunately he decided to drop. 

At this point I had somewhat given up on the 24-hour attempt, the only silver lining to the slowness was that I felt pretty damn fresh. We had drifted about 30 mins off 24-hour pace, but perhaps there was still hope? Given that I knew the next 15 or so kms I felt confident to push the pace hard - I was also pretty certain I would be able to finish this thing in under 30 hours, so why not roll the dice a little and try put 24 hours within the realms of possible?

We had been around 90th place at Box Hill and had been overtaken a lot, I began running hard for the next 2 aid stations, managing to to restore some of the deficit - 24 was possible but highly unlikely. As was mentioned in a couple other race reports (), the skies opened up during the point - I was grateful for the fresh cool air but found the wet mud hard to ascend in road shoes.

At this point I want to mention the fantastic aid station crew. I generally hate wasting time at aid stations - I race hard to gain every minute and don't want to spend more than a few seconds standing around. The Centurion crew have this down to a tee:

1. Run into aid station, hand over 2 water bottles
1. Centurion crew full bottles whilst I grab snacks and sandwiches
1. Crew hand back water bottles
1. Leave aid station

I think I averaged around 30 to 40s per an aid station, this is what a Formula 1 driver must experience - amazing!

When I got to the half-way point in 10 hours and 30 minutes I was feeling sore from the fast pace, but had now completed 2 marathons on-target. The amazing crew sat me down, brought me over food and drink and my drop bag.  I woofed down the fantastic warm pasta and changed shoes and socks. I opted to go for compression socks party for nettle protection and also my trail shoes to avoid any more slipping and sliding through the more technical night section.

I rang Tanya who was going to pace me later to let her know my progress.

As I pulled out of the half-way point I met up with a group of other runners and we criss/cross chatted and ran together helping us through this 16 km section - thanks to [Karl](http://www.karlrunsfar.com/), Paul, Johnathan and the other runners who made the run that much more enjoyable - if you are ever in London feel free to drop me a line for a pint to say thanks!

For some reason I had misread the length of this run and thought it was 10 kms rather than 10 miles (mind playing tricks!) the net effect was that I ran out of water with about 4 kms to go. This was a real struggle as the day was still warm and I worried about dropping behind in hydration.

#### CP8 &rarr; CP11  <small>(96.2 to 131.5kms)</small>
###### Aid stations:  Holly Hill, Bluebell Hill, Detling

As I pulled up to aid station 8 I have a very welcome surprise, my crew were just walking into the station for me! For some reason I thought I wasn't meeting them so early so was very glad to see them. After the low point or running out of water, not to mention having run nearly 100 kms, it was going to be amazing having fresh legs to leech!

Amusingly I had the crew that I would be in-and-out of aid stations in a minute or less. Ironically I needed a good 5 minutes to compose myself at CP8, the pace and low water had really taken it's toll. After drinking some water, 2 cups of coke, half and orange, a handful of grapes, 1 sandwich I WAS READY TO GO! Tanya and I waved farewell to the NDW100-Crew and we were on our way.

Having run for around 11 hours at this point I was perhaps a little less chatty than Tanya expected but she did a fantastic job running with me. When she joined it was still quite warm, but the sun slowly set and we had to turn our head-torches on. This section of the course was very runnable and we kept the pace high, pushing hard to try keep the 24-hour dream alive.

After Tanyas stint I was joined by a very energetic Martin, fresh from his Marathon run to help me ascend Bluebell Hill - unfortunately for Martin he joined me at a pretty low point of the race. Some confusion over check-points and the high-pace of the previous section had sapped some of my mental strength.

Everyone talks about Box Hill and Detling when discussing the NDW100, I am going to add Bluebell Hill onto that list. It's long, annoying and not much fun. Furthermore, you know this is just a prelude to Detling. I didn't like that hill one bit - good riddance!

As we arrived at the Bluebell Hill aid station at 11pm and I was surprised Sam had returned to cheer me on! After that horrendous hill it helped raise my spirits to see my usual partner in running crime. He also pointed our I only had 1 marathon to go, and 7 hours to make that it in - simples (or was it?).

Karl, my adopted NDW running buddy was chilling out in the a chair. We mumbled a few words of good luck and both set off at roughly the same time. Helen was joining me for the next 20kms or so before handing over to my final pacer of the night. Almost immediately after setting off I felt very chilled and opted to put my running jacket on - this turned out to be a great idea as the evening was chilly at times.

I feel sorry for Helen for 2 reasons:

1. Not 5 minutes out of the CP and we both walked into a very deep puddle and got super wet shoes, argh!
1. The Hills.

Now Box Hill may be more famous, but the hills in Detling and unrelenting. No sooner do you ascend a hill, then do you drop down and have to do it all over again. Much like the Oner both the downhills and the uphills are not really runable, they are just too steep and slippery for anyone to seriosuly tackle at speed at 1 am. So we ground it out, running where we could, stomping where we had to.

I will always remember a section where we emerged from a steep incline, the path opened up and we surged ahead, enjoying 15 minutes of fast pace running - storming along. It's times like these in a race where the experience can be surreal and beautiful.

As we pulled into Detling Village Hall I felt great, we had managed to keep the pace bang on - the whole team was there to check Helen and I were good. I ate some much needed soup and drank some Dr. Pepper, thanks again Centurion team for brining the food over to my table! A few of the runners I had been chatting to earlier were sitting down I had a brief chat with them and decided that there was no time like the present and we were off.

What can I say about the next section. More and steeper hills.

As we got into Hollingbourne crew station, the highs of the previous aid station were crushed. My legs ached, my mind felt broken and to be frank 24 hours seemed damn unlikely at this point. I sat in the back of the car, sipped on a drink and talked to the team about what needed to be done. We had 35 km in around 5 and a half hours. After 131 kms it had come to this. For a brief moment I gave up on the dream - and decided to grind out the finish - 24 hours, 25 hours, who cares? I looked at my crew and was grateful for all their support.

#### CP11 &rarr; FIN  <small>(131.5 to 166kms)</small>
###### Aid stations:  Lenham, Dunn Street, Ashford

Dan, my final pacer, and I pulled out of the crew point and hit the first of a few demoralizing hills. I tried my best to run but I just couldn't get moving. We surged again ,only to be met by another steep incline. Dan glanced down at his phone, the crew had been tracking our progress and relayed that we were way off pace - 24 hours was blown. Fuck that. As if by magic, my mind clicked into place - I told Dan, get in front and run. You set the pace and I will follow. Boy did we run! I felt fantastic, we dropped into 6 to 5:30kms we were a freight-train crushing the lovely countryside!. Dan kept the motivation up, and my brain going by calling out pacing in miles, 10 minute miles, wtf - I never do miles! We could do this!


As I pulled into Ashford and did my lap of the stadium emption swept over me. The day had not gone according to plan. From Sam dropping out, to the physical strain it had been a herculean effort. Mind over body.

Sam, Tanya, Martin and Martin cheered as we crossed the finish line in 23 hours and 40mins!

#### Aftermath

It's been about a week now since I finished the NDW100. Most of the aches and pains have subsided though a lingering shin splint is not quite gone, which is weird as I never have shin splints.

My feet were super super swollen this time - I think I must have over-tightened the trail shoe.

> Remember to loosen shoes as the race goes on.

Thanks to my amazing pacing team and the fantastic Centurion team.

#### Background

Having finished the 46 mile (75 km) <a href="http://www.beaconsultra.com/" target="_blank">Brecon Beacons Ultra 2016</a> in just under 10 hours, I was feeling more confident with the step-up from marathon distance. My first attempt at ultra distances - a self-supported 60km run - still left me with painful memories of bleeding inner thighs and exhaustion for the final 10km. Lessons were learned, mitigations were deployed, and 46 miles through the Brecon Beacons was both successful and pretty fun.

> TLDR: Eat more, drink more, use electrolytes and smother yourself in bodyglide.

Pain is quickly forgotten, and it wasn't long before I dropped a somewhat (very) drunken text to my friend Sam inquiring if he would be interested in running two ultra races in 2017, the Oner being a qualifier for the other. Sam replied with *maybe* and I forwarded him my completed sign up email as encouragement. A few weeks later he came to his senses (got equally drunk) and signed-up for both runs too.

Fast forward a few months and it was time to put on our running shoes and trek out to my old rock climbing haunting ground, <a href="https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/book.php?id=19" target="_blank">Swanage</a>, and do battle with some slightly less vertical pitches.

#### Planning

After a hectic few weeks of work and an extremely spotty training schedule it dawned on Sam and I that we were perhaps out of our depth with the step-up in distance. It was nearly double the furthest distance we had done before and neither of us had ever run through the night.

After reading a large amount of race reports our concerns were confirmed; this was not going to be as easy as 26 back-to-back Park Runs. Our first attempt to come up with a game plan involved analyzing previous race results, theoretical run performance and elevation change. The result was the below monstrosity that only an accountant could love:

        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

After thinking outside of the cell we came up with a solution. Split the run into approximately three marathons:

1. Bank some time in Marathon one as it is a bit flat
1. Waste some time in Marathon 2 due to HQ/Food but catch it up with some nice flats
1. Siege the hills and end with our well fought for banked time.


> BAM! A 21 hour finish time.

The net result was the below race-plan completed the night before the run:

#### Pre-start

The Brutal team put together a very well oiled machine, kit-check, pre-race-brief and all that jazz that was as efficient and as painless as could be. A few nervous laughs and the 63 Oner runners and 6 Half-Oner runners crowded into provided mini-vans for the journey from Race-HQ/Half-way to the start. The long-drive ride was intimidating; nearly an hour drive to the start! In our bus it became very apparent that Sam and I were less experienced at 100km+ runs than our fellow passengers - joy.

#### Start &rarr; CP4  <small>(0 to 47.8kms)</small>

Race start was pushed back by 15mins due to a delayed mini-van, but before we knew it we were off.

Our strategy revolved around banking a bit of time in the first couple of marathons so we set off at a fair clip. The start was also a downhill section, so why not? As we hit the first proper hill we enjoyed a walk with views, and spirits were high.

The rest of the first ~10k to CP1 was relatively uneventful and we made good time. After hitting the well-stocked aid station and grabbing some snacks we cracked on to tackle the next ~12kms. All of a sudden we ground to a halt. We had hit West Bay and the path was a tad unclear. Luckily a local runner picked us up and we were soon back on our way. This was an early reminder that navigation was important and keeping a bearing would save time in the future, not to mention this was supposed to be a simple section of the course.

Before and after CP2 there is a mixed pebble and sand section. The temptation is to run it, given the earliness in the race, but this is very challenging and tiring in this terrain. The harder you push the deeper you slide into the sand, so simpler to tread lightly and walk. We hadn't really practiced running on this surface so found the technique a bit cumbersome. It was at this point that we ran with a few other runners through some hard packed sand and dirt. The other runners slowly pulled away looking super strong. It turned out that we had just been schooled by the eventual female winner, Raquel Alfonso and friends. 

We gladly left the beach and started on a long section of gradual rolling hills and flat sections, a welcome respite from the sand. Unfortunately at the same time the sun finally took its toll. After stomping up a grassy hill we hit 2nd gear to make up some time on flats. Almost immediately I felt a searing pain in my right quad muscle and I was stopped dead in my tracks. Walking - let alone running - was impossible. I thought that this was the end of my run, only 30km in. We both stopped and I massaged the muscle for a couple minutes whilst we were passed by a few other runners. I downed a GU gel and decided to slowly walk. The pain slowly diminished but I decided to give it another couple minutes. I stopped again and drank a sip of water. A few minutes later we started again, the pain was manageable and we decided to push on. After a little while the pain faded away and we just had to contend with the sun.

> Note to self: get a running hat


At this point we slowed the pace a little as we were both suffering a little bit from the sun and the earlier pace. We decided to stick religiously to our planned pace, which was give-or-take on target. A few people overtook us at this point but we stuck to our game plan, we also had a sprightly conversation with Victoria Miller before she pulled away to finish as second female.

We uneventfully pushed through CP3 and looked forward to finishing the first marathon. There was a good amount of shade and a slight breeze which aided our running and we caught up with a few runners  at the marathon pit stop. The course medic warned the group about the dangers of not consuming enough salt and too much water. A few moments later we pushed on to cross the land bridge between Weymouth and Portland, and hit CP4.

> Side note: before the run Sam and I had discussed aid station strategy. I am very pro the briefest of stops and avoid the temptation to linger. Sam preferred a slightly more measured approach. With 11 aid stations, 3min stops equate to over half an hour. In the end we came to some middle ground which worked well. We were also careful not to forgo water in this heat.

###Â CP4 &rarr; CP6  <small>(47.8 to 57.2km)</small>

After a light bite of pasta and some flapjacks we hit the trail to do the island loop. The race stewards indicated we could get around in daylight/dusk and as it was a lot cooler we decided to see what we could do. Not 10 minutes out of HQ Sam dropped a bombshell. He would most likely drop out at CP6, he'd been feeling sick for the past 10-15km and he didn't think he'd be able to finish. I just told him to see how he felt and make up his mind when we get back to CP6 (Note from Sam: what Ian actually said was "Hahahah no *expletive* way are you dropping out", end of discussion). After another 10 minutes Sam dropped off to visit Mother Nature, I pressed on and he caught up with me a few minutes later. He mentioned he had a little vomit and felt a bit better - too much sugar and other junk. From that point forward Sam switched to water, he wasn't used to running with electrolytes. We hit CP5, grabbed a cheese and pickle sandwich (delicious) and he started to feel better.

Now that we had got over that little challenge we decided to crank the pace up a bit. We really hit our stride and caught up with one of the runners we raced with before the end of the first marathon, Jeff. We decided to run together for a little bit and Jeff was telling us this was his second Oner attempt having been timed out at CP8 last year. Midnight would also mark his birthday! As we ran past a few crags I had climbed in the past I mentioned the routes I did, we were really hitting our stride and making fantastic progress. We had slipped 15 minutes behind our original check point target, but we were catching up rapidly. 

As we admired the high cliffs on our left we began to look for the sharp left turn that cuts back past the old prison and back into town. At this point I will mention we were using a mobile phone with the Oner GPX path loaded up. A mixture of GPS and the path allowed us to pretty much stay on track, but we also had the oner maps and a compass for emergencies. We hit the location of the turn, according to the GPS, but no turn was in sight. We ran on for a bit, thinking the GPS might be inaccurate, but no obvious turn materialised. We must have missed the left turning, but where was it? All we had seen for the last km or so was high cliffs. We started making our way back to the left turn and we collected 3 other lost runners. Though using GPS and the GPX file to navigate we hadn't bothered downloading the actual terrain or satellite maps. In a moment of clarity (we were about 8 hours into this thing), I flipped the phone to satellite mode. Everything became clear. The path we had been running along had been wrong for over a km, the correct path was atop the cliffs! The line from the GPX file was not fine enough as to distinguish the 15m difference in paths which effectively ran side-by-side. Two of the other runners made an attempt to scale the bush and find a direct path up the cliff but this didn't feel right. Tracing back a km or so, right next to the crags I had climbed, was the proper route up to the top. A snap decision was made - we would run the km or so back. I was very annoyed with myself for this massive diversion and waste of energy. We were now having to wear head torches and some of our enthusiasm had been dashed. The rest of this leg back to HQ was uneventful, we made one other error - not stopping at a chippy to pick up a burger or pizza - but we got back to HQ well within cut-off.

Over 40 minutes and an extra 2.2km had been run. Things were going to get tight.
The only good news was Sam was feeling good. A quick pit stop, some soup, a change of shoes, 20mins or so and we were back on the road!

### CP6 &rarr; CP7  <small>(57.2 to 77km)</small>

The next section was a pretty long 18km. I feel like this section is designed for a few reasons:

1. Allow runners to bank some time before the hills. It's pretty flat
2. Weed out those who would not make the night (it was already dark when we left CP6)
3. Get through the city as quickly as possible 

It was interesting to see some native English wildlife, the clubs and bars were busy but other than not super interesting. So far we had been using our running watch to do a total aggregate time and distance for the run and then work out our progress on each check point relative to the start of that check point. This started to break down for two reasons. The first is that the distances were all amuck with minor detours here and there and as such the course distance and the run distance were not quite the same. Secondly we were getting tired and calculating distances and average speeds became too much effort. This came to a head as CP7 took forever to arrive. From this point on we reset the watch between check points, allowing us to easily monitor our pace against our plan and the distances too.

***

### CP7 &rarr; CP9 <small>(77 to 98.2km)</small>

It's 30 minutes past midnight and little do we know it, but the race is just about to begin. The following two checkpoints melded into a long arduous siege against mother nature. The rolling hills were too steep to run up and were too dangerous and steep to attempt to run down. This meant picking our way carefully up and down each unrelenting hill. As soon as we hit a flat we would hit the gas and start jogging, but as soon as you got going you hit another steep section. Highlights of this section included:

1. Stopping at Durdle Door, turning our lights off and enjoying the epic view provided by the moon
1. Hitting a long windy downhill and racing two other runners for ages

It was whilst racing the other two runners that we made a minor error and ran about 100m in the wrong direction. Running back and seeing them far-off in the distance (400m now) was quite disheartening. Due to tiredness of both parties Sam lost a little faith in my route finding skills so I made an extra effort to not error on the next up-and-down section. We were only a couple of km from the next aid station and not feeling too terrible. Whilst concentrating on the map I managed to put my left leg into a hole and twisted my ankle, ouch! Sam asked if I was okay, I replied; "I'm fine, this hill is not going to walk itself". I worried that I wouldn't be able to keep the pace up to meet the various CP cut-offs. As we neared the checkpoint I decided to keep this to myself and just see what happens.

As we pulled up to the check-point, we saw <a href="http://www.brutalevents.co.uk/d_miller_brutal_blog.html">*two other runners*</a>.

### CP9 &rarr; CP10 <small>(98.2 to 107.9kms)</small>

The first thing that happened when we pulled up to the checkpoint was that my left ankle clicked back in position. Pain instantly gone, absolute relief. 

The second thing was that we had a quick chat with the other two runners we had been leapfrogging for the last 2 checkpoints. The first was sitting on a chair at the checkpoint and looked like he wasn't having a great time. The checkpoint stewards were giving him a little pep talk, though we didn't catch the exchange. After chatting with the second runner about our little misadventure and him mentioning that he had run the course before, we decided to join up and run together. We were assured that the final two checkpoints and finish were flatter. In retrospect, _less hilly_ may have been the right term, it was by no means flat.

The four of us set off on a mission to finish this thing. We hadn't come this far to not finish. The second runner, who introduced himself as Rory, warned us that there was a painful steep staircase straight off the bat. The first runner, Dave, kept mum and had his poles at the ready. We started up the stairs, each runner battling his own demons to make the climb. Dave was battling and his legs did not want to ascend the hills. After we reached the top of the staircase we looked back and Dave was no longer in view. Rory shouted down the hill but we heard no reply. We decided to press on. Sadly our expectation was that Dave's race was over, the cut-off times were now quite tight and would require a massive mental commitment to finish. We all hoped that we would see him at the finish, but acknowledged this was highly unlikely.

We had never met Rory before but he regaled us with his previous Oner attempt where a mistimed snooze cost him the finish, a reminder of how keeping up a good consistent time was imperative. The three of us worked like a machine pushing through the check-point. Rory had a slightly different running style to Sam and I but we made it work for 90% of the CP, he pulled away towards the end as we couldn't quite keep up, but met him again at CP10 for a bite to eat.

The Oner always has something up it's sleeve and is quite relentless with giving and then taking away. For example, we had got used to each check-point being about 12kms, after Rory pulled away we checked our time sheet and discovered this checkpoint to only be 9.6km long! We were only 500m away, the lighthouse! A few minutes later, after turning a corner, we found that between us and the end was a massive descent and then a painful staircase. A minute's silence and we begrudgingly made our way down-and-up.

***

### CP10 &rarr; Finish <small>(107.9 to 131.9km)</small>

As we pulled away from the second to last check-point we started making a few calculations about getting to the end. After our detour earlier in the race, and the hills being a touch tougher than expected, our 21 hour time was blown. We had some confidence in finishing, but wanted a good buffer for the last check-point. We felt like we had pulled some time back from CP9 &rarr; CP10 but still needed a bit more time.

What followed was some of the most intense mental control where we pushed harder than ever before to crush this 11.1km section. We managed to catch-up and overtake around 10 runners and really upped the ante to make sure we would finish. The net result was hitting CP11 with over a 2.5 hour buffer to do 12.6km. After running for 21 hours non-stop, this seemed like enough to bring this home.

The last part of the run was a mix of strolling, running, and avoiding naked men on the beach. Given we had given ourselves around a 50% chance of finishing we were pretty chuffed. Running the bridge with everyone clapping and being handed the Oner medal a large relief swept over me.

Fin.
