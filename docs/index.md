#### Background

Having finished the 46 Mile/74 Kms <a href="http://www.beaconsultra.com/" target="_blank">Brecon Beacons Ultra 2016</a> in just under 10 hours, I was feeling more confident with the step-up from marathon distance. The painful adventure of my first self-supported 60km run, bleeding inner thighs and zonking for the last 10 km, had given first-hand experience of the caveats of going post-marathon - the mitigations had been deployed successfully and 46 miles had been pretty fun.

> TLDR: Eat more, drink more, use electrolytes and smother yourself in bodyglide.

Having the memory of a fruit fly for pain I dropped a somewhat (very) drunken text to Sam inquiring if he would be interested in running 2  ultra races in 2017, the oner a pre-requisite for the other. As Sam replied with *maybe*, I forwarded him my competed signup email - a few weeks later he came to his senses and signed-up for both runs too.

Fast forward a few months and it was time to put on our running boots and trek out to my old rock climbing haunting ground, <a href="https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/book.php?id=19" target="_blank">Swanage</a>, and do battle with some slightly less vertical pitches.

#### Planning

After a hectic few weeks of work and a spotty training schedule it dawned on Sam and I that we were perhaps out of our depth with the step-up in distance - it was nearly double the distance we had done before.

After reading a large amount of race reports our concerns were confirmed, this was not going to be as easy as 33 back-to-back Parkruns. Our first attempt to come up with a game plan involved analyzing previous race results, theoretic run performance and elevation change. The result was the below monstrosity only an accountant could love:

      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
<div>

After thinking outside of the cell we came up with a solution. Split the run into approximately 3 marathons, in order:

1. Bank some time in Marathon one as it is a bit flat
1. Waste some time in Marathon 2 due to HQ/Food but catch it up with some nice flats
1. Siege the hills and end with our well fought for banked time.


> BAM! a 21 hour finish time.

The net result was the below race-plan completed the night before the run:

#### Pre-start

The Brutual team put together a very well oiled machine, kit-check, pre-race-brief and all that jazz was as efficient and as painless as could be. A few nervous laughs and the 63 Oner runners and 6 Half-Oner runners crowded into provided mini-vans for the journey from Race-HQ/Half-way to the start. The long-drive ride was intimidating; nearly an hour drive to the start! In our bus it became very apparent that Sam and I were less experienced at 100km+ runs than our fellow passengers, joy.

#### Start &rarr; CP4  <small>(0 to 47.8kms)</small>

Race start was pushed back by 15mins due to a delayed min-van, but before we knew it were were off.

Our strategy revolved around banking a bit of time in the first couple marathons so we set off at a fair clip, the start was also a downhill section so why not? As we hit the first proper hill we enjoyed a walk with views, spirits were high.

The rest of the first ~10k to check-point 1 was relatively uneventful and we made good time, after hitting the aid station and grabbing some snacks we cracked on to tackle the next ~12kms. All of a sudden we ground to a halt. We had hit West Bay and the path was a tad unclear, a local runner picked us up and we were back on our way. This was an early reminder that navigation was important and keeping a bearing would save time in the future, not to mention this was supposed to be a simple section of the course.

Before and after checkpoint 2 there is a mixed pebble and sand section. So early in the day the temptation to try run which is pretty challenging on this terrain. The harder you push the deeper you slide into the sand, so simpler to tread lightly and walk. We hadn't really practiced running on this surface so found the technique a bit cumbersome. It was at this point that we ran with a few other runners through some hard packed sand and dirt. The other runners slowly pulled away looking super strong, turns out we had just been schooled by the eventual female winner, Raquel Alfonso and friends. 

We gladly left the beach and started a long section of gradule rollin hills and flat sections, welcome respite from the sand. Unfortunately at the same time the sun finally took its toll. After stomping up a grassy hill we hit 2nd gear to make up some time on flats. Almost immediately I had a searing pain in my right quad muscle, I was stopped in my tracks. Walking let alone running was impossible, I thought that this was the end of my run, only 30ish Km in, that's a Sunday stroll. Sam stopped and I massaged the muscle for a couple minutes whilst we were passed by a few other runners. I downed a gu gell and decided to slowly walk. The pain was less but I decided to give it another couple minutes, I stopped again and drank a sip of water.  A few minutes later we started again, the pain was manageable and we decided to push on. After a little while the pain faded away and we just had to contend with the sun

> note to self: get a running hat


At this point we slowed the pace a little as we were both suffering a little bit from the sun and earlier pace. We decided to stick religiously to our planned pace, which was give-or-take on target. A few people overtook us at this point but we stuck to our game, we also had a sprightly conversation with Victoria Miller before she pulled away to finish as second female.

We uneventfully pushed through Check point 3 and looked forward to finishing the first marathon. There was a good amount of shade and a slight breeze which aided our running and we caught up with a few runners  at the marathon pit stop. The course medic warned the group about the dangers of not consuming enough salt and too much water, a few moments later we pushed on to cross the land bridge between Weymouth and Portland, and hit check point 4.

> side note: before the run sam and I had discussed aid station strategy. I am very pro the briefest of stops and avoid the temptation to linger. Sam preferred a slightly more measured approach. With 11 aid statins, 3min stops  equate to over half an hour. In the end we came to some middle ground which worked well. We were also careful not to forgo water with this heat.

### CP4 &rarr; CP6  <small>(47.8 to 57.2kms)</small>

After a light bite of pasta and some flapjacks we hit the trail to do the island loop. The race stewards indicated we could get around in daylight/dusk and as it was a lot cooler we decided to see what we could do. Not 10minutes out of HQ sam dropped a bombshell. He would most likely drop out at CP6, his stomach was not doing great and he didn't have another 80 odd Kilometres in him. I was surprised as though sam hadn't been in the best of spirits I didn't think it has been anyway near that bad. I just told him to see how he felt and make up his mind when we get there. After another 10mins or so Sam dropped off to visit Mother Nature, I pressed on and he caught up with me a few minutes later. He mentioned he had a little vomit and felt a touch better - too much sugar and other junk. We hit CP5, grabbed a cheese and pickle sandwich (delicious) and started to feel better. 

Now that we had got over that little challenge we decided to crank the pace up a bit. We really hit our stride and caught up with one of the runners we raced with before the end of the first marathon, Jeff. We decided to run together for a little bit and Jeff was telling us this was his second Oner attempt having been timed out at CP. Midnight was also his birthday. As we ran past a few crags I had climbed in the past I mentioned the routes I did, we were really hitting our stride and making fantastic progress, we had slipped 15mins behind our originally check point goal, but was catching up rapidly. 

As we admired the high cliffs on our left we began look for the sharp left turn that cuts back through the old prison and back into town. At this point I will mention we were using a mobile phone with the oner GPX path loaded up. A mixture of GPS and the path allowed us to pretty much stay on track, we also had the oner maps and a compass for emergencies. The location of the left p something was amiss. We just have missed the left turning, but where was it? All we had seen for the last km or so was high cliffs, we started making our way back to the left turn and we collected 3 other lost runners. An attempt was made to scale the bush and find a path up the wall but this didn't feel right. Though usi GPS and the GPX file to navigate we hadn't bothered downloading the actual terrian or satellite maps. In a moment of clarity, we were about 8 hours into this thing I flipped the phone to satellite mode. Everything became clear. The path we had been running along had been wrong for over a km, the correct path was atop the cliffs! The line from the GPX file was not fine enough as to distinguish the 15m difference in paths which effectively ran side-by-side. Tracing back a km or so, right next to the crags I had climbed, was the route up to the top. A snap decision was made - we would run the Km or so back. I was very annoyed with myself for this massive diversion and waste of of our good energy, we were now having to wear head torches and some of the enthusiasm had been dashed. Two of our fellow runners decided to continue on their attempt to scale the wall, sam and I bid them good luck and pushed back. The rest of this leg back to HQ was uneventful, we made one other error - not stopping at a choppy to pick up a burger of pizza - but we got back to HQ within the timelimit.

Over 40mins and an extra 2.2kms had been run. Things were going to get tight.
The only good news was Sam was feeling good, a quick pit stop, some soup, a change of shoes, 20mins or so and we were back on the road!

### CP6 &rarr; CP7  <small>(57.2 to 77kms)</small>

The next section was a pretty long 17kms. I feel like this section is designed for a few reasons:

1. Allow runners to bank some time before the hills. It's pretty flat
2. Weed out those who would not make the night
3. Get through the city as quickly as possible 

It was interesting to see some native English wildlife, the clubs and bars were busy but other than than not super interesting. So far we had been using our running watch to do a total aggregate time and distance for the run and then work out our progress on each check point relative to the start of that check point. This started to break down for two reasons. The first is that the distances were all amuck with minor detours here and there and as such the course distance and the run distance were not quite the same. Secondly we were getting tired and calculating distances and average speeds became too much effort. This came to a head as this checkpoint took forever to come. From this point on we reset the watch between check points.

***

### CP7 &rarr; CP9 <small>(77 to 98.2kms)</small>

It's 30 minutes past midnight and little do we know it, but the race is just about to begin. The following two check-points melded into a long arduous siege against mother nature. The rolling hills were too steep to run up and were too dangerous  and steep to attempt to run down. This meant picking our way carefully up and down each unrelenting hill. As soon as you hit a flat, at the base or roof of a hill we would hit the gas as jog but as soon as you got going you hit another steep section. Highlights of this section included:

1. Stopping at Durdle Door, turning our lights off and enjoying the epic view provided by the moon
1. Hitting a long windy downhill and racing two other runners for ages

It was whilst racing the other two runners that we made a minor error and ran about 100m in the wrong direction, running back and seeing them far-off in the distance (400m now) was quite disheartening. Due to tirdness on bath paraties Sam suddenly lost a little faith in my route finding skills so I made an extra effort to not error on the next up-and-down section, we were only a couple of kms out from the next aid station and not feeling too terrible. Whilst concetrating on the map I managed to put my left leg into a hole and twisted my ankle. That was it, game over. Sam asked if I was okay, which I mumbled a not very friendly, "I'm fine, this hill is not going to walk itself". At we slowly ticked away the kms to the check-point the twisted ankle still hurt, I worried that I wouldn't be able to keep the pace up to meet the various CP cut-offs. As we neared the checkpoint I decided to keep this to myself and just see what happens.

As we pulled up to the check-point, we saw <a href="http://www.brutalevents.co.uk/d_miller_brutal_blog.html">*two other runners*</a>.

***

### CP9 &rarr; CP10 <small>(98.2 to 107.9kms)</small>

The first thing that happened when we pulled up to the checkpoint was that my left ankle clicked back in position. Pain instantly gone, absolute relief. 

The second thing was that we had a quick chat with other two runners, we had been leapfrogging for the last 2 checkpoints. The first was sitting on a chair at the checkpoint and looked like he wasn't having a great time, the checkpoint stewards were giving him a little pep talk, though the words were lost on us. After chatting with the second runner about our little misadventure and him mentioning he ran the course before we decided to join up and run together. We were assured that the final two checkpoints and finish were flatter. In retrospect, _less hilly_ may have been the right term, it was by no-means flat.

The four of us set off on a mission to finish this thing. We hadn't come this far to not finish. The second runner, who introduced himself as Rory warned us that there was a painful steep staircase straight off the bat. The first runner, Dave, kept mum and had his poles at the ready. We started up the stairs, each runner battling his own demons to make the climb. Dave was battling and his legs did not want to ascend the hills. After we reached the top of the staircase we looked back and Dave was no longer in view. Rory shouted down the hill but we head no reply, we decided to press on. Sadly our expectation was that Dave's race was over, the cut-off times were now quite tight and would require a massive mental commitment to finish. We all hoped that we would see him at the finish, but acknowledged this was highly unlikely.

We had never met Rory before but he regaled us with his previous Oner attempt where a mistimed snooze cost him the finish, a reminder of how keeping up a good consistent time was imperative. The three of us worked like a machine pushing through the check-point. Rory had a slightly different running style to Sam and I but we made it work for 90% of the CP, he pulled away towards the end as we couldn't quite keep up, but met him again at CP10 for a bite to eat.

The Oner always has something up it's sleeve and is quite relentless with giving and then taking away. For example, we had got used to each check-point being about 12kms, after Rory pulled away we checked out time sheet and discoverd this checkpoint to only be 9.6km long! We were only 500m away, the lighthouse! A few minutes later, after turning a corner, we found that between us was massive descent and then a painful staircase. A minutes silence and we begrudgingly made our way down-and-up.

***

### CP10 &rarr; Finish <small>(107.9 to 131.9kms)</small>

As we pulled away from the second to last check-point we started making a few calculations on getting to the end. After our detour earlier in the race, and the hills being a touch tougher than expected our 21 hour time was blown. We had some confidence in finishing, but wanted a good buffer for the last check-point. We felt like we had pulled some time back from CP9 &rarr; CP10 but still needed a bit more time.

What followed was some of the most intense mental control where we pushed harder than ever before to crush this 11.1km section. We managed to catch-up and overtake around 10 runners and really upped the ante to make sure we would finish. The net result was hitting CP11 with over a 2.5 hour buffer to do 12.6km. After running just for 21+ hours non-stop, this seemed like enough to bring this home.

The last part of the run was a mix of strolling, running, and avoiding naked men on the beach. Given we had given ourselves around a 50% chance of finishing we were pretty chuffed. Running the bridge with everyone clapping and being handed the Oner medal a large relief swept over me.
